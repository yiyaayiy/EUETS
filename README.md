# EU ETS Data Analysis Project

## Overview

- **Merged and cleaned datasets** (to be uploaded).
- **R scripts**:
  - A master script to orchestrate the project workflow.
  - Scripts for cleaning and pre-processing the data.
  - Reusable functions for modular and efficient data analysis.


## Repository Structure
- 00_raw_data - Raw publicly available EU ETS datasets (to be uploaded).
